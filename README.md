## About
This project cantains implementation of a fully playable first person shooter game called "Your Money or Your Life". It is a multiplayer game made using Unity engine and Photon Engine - PUN. The game is set in the wild west world with lovely low poly graphics by Synty Studios. Players take on the role of cowboys who fight with each other for gold.

An interesting aspect of this game is the fact that the gold earned by the players is both their life points and points in the leaderboard. Whenever a player is shot, they drop some of their gold coins on the ground. Other players can then pick them up to add them to their score. This unique mechanics creates many interesting dynamics and scenarios. 

"Your Money or Your Life" contains full game loop. After starting the application players are greeted with main menu. From there they can fiddle with game options or go straight to the gameplay menu. This menu contais character selection, multiplayer rooms list and creation screens, playable maps select and room lobby. While in-game, players will see complete UI with bullet & coins display, ranking table, crosshair, pause menu etc. Of course players will see each other's player models - fully animated and synced throughout the network - running around the selected map. The rounds in the game are time-limited, and at the end of the rounds, players will be judged by the number of coins collected.

I consider this project a complete game and I am not planning to expand on it further, but to be honest it is probably more of a considerable MVP.
